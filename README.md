  Raspberry Pi Automotive Computer for 2008 Buick Lucerne 

**Description**

 The goal is creating an on board automotive computer system that is:   
  * A Solution for:   
      1. Media  
      2. Navigation   
      3. Hands Free Calling   
      4. Engine Monitoring  
      5. Data Logging    
  * Simplistic Enough to Use While Driving   
  * Designed to Support Further Extensiblity    

The basic idea is to equip my 2008 Buick Lucerne CX with some of the amenities that have become standard in more modern 
cars (and possibly a few that are not quite as standard,) using the Raspberry Pi as the brains, a 128GB SSD for local 
storage, Bluetooth and WiFi adapters for general connectivity, a Bluetooth capable OBD II ELM 327  Adapter for engine 
data, and a custom built in dash unit with LCD touch screen for control and display. Ideally I will also be able to use 
some of the existing hardware such as the OnStar microphone, antenna, and the existing steering wheel audio controls as 
well to make an overall seamless replacement for the current stereo system.
